# The following patch is to use a version of ark-r1cs-std compatible with
# v0.4.0 but that includes a cherry-picked commit from after v0.4.0 which fixes
# the in-circuit scalar multiplication of the zero point. The commit is from
# https://github.com/arkworks-rs/r1cs-std/pull/124, without including other
# changes done between v0.4.0 and this fix which would break compatibility.
