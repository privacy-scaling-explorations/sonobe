# Solidity Verifiers CLI

Solidity Verifiers CLI is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool to generate the Solidity smart contracts that verify proofs of Zero Knowledge cryptographic protocols. This tool is developed by the collaborative efforts of the PSE (Privacy & Scaling Explorations) and 0xPARC teams.

Solidity Verifiers CLI is released under the MIT license, but notice that the Solidity template for the Groth16 verification has GPL-3.0 license, hence the generated Solidity verifiers that use the Groth16 template will have that license too.

## Supported Protocols

Solidity Verifier currently supports the generation of Solidity smart contracts for the verification of proofs in the following Zero Knowledge protocols:

- **Groth16:**
  - Efficient and succinct zero-knowledge proof system.
  - Template credit: [Jordi Baylina - Groth16 Verifier Template](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs/blob/master/templates/verifier_groth16.sol.ejs)

- **KZG:**
  - Uses the Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg polynomial commitment scheme.

- **Nova + CycleFold Decider:**
  - Implements the decider circuit verification for the Nova proof system in conjunction with the CycleFold protocol optimization.

## Usage

```bash
solidity-verifiers-cli [OPTIONS] -p <PROTOCOL> -k <PROTOCOL_VK> -o <OUTPUT_PATH>
```

A real use case (which was used to test the tool itself):
`solidity-verifiers-cli -p groth16 -k ./solidity-verifiers/assets/G16_test_vk`
This would generate a Groth16 verifier contract for the given G16 verifier key (which consists of the G16_Vk only) and store this contract in `$pwd`.

### Options:
    -v, --verbose: Increase logging verbosity
    -q, --quiet: Decrease logging verbosity
    -p, --protocol <PROTOCOL>: Selects the protocol for which to generate the Decider circuit Solidity Verifier (possible values: groth16, kzg, nova-cyclefold)
    -o, --out <OUT>: Sets the output path for all generated artifacts
    -k, --protocol-vk <PROTOCOL_VK>: Sets the input path for the file containing the verifier key required by the protocol chosen such that the verification contract can be generated.
    --pragma <PRAGMA>: Selects the Solidity compiler version to be set in the Solidity Verifier contract artifact
    -h, --help: Print help (see a summary with '-h')
    -V, --version: Print version

## License
Solidity Verifier CLI is released under the MIT license, but notice that the Solidity template for the Groth16 verification has GPL-3.0 license, hence the generated Solidity verifiers will have that license too.
