///   `W = (w, e, ...)` and `U = (u, x, ...)` satisfy Relaxed R1CS if
///   `Az ∘ Bz = uCz + e`, where `z = [u, x, w]`.
///   (commitments in `U` are not checked here)
///
///   Also, `W` and `U` have non-native field elements as their components when
///   used as CycleFold witness and instance.

///   `W = (w, ...)` and `U = (x, e, β, ...)` satisfy Relaxed R1CS if
