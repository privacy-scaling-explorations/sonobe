# `solidity-verifiers`

This crate implements templating logic to output verifier contracts for `sonobe`-generated decider proofs.
This crate is accompanied by the [cli](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/sonobe/tree/main/cli) crate, which allows to generate the Solidity contracts from the command line.

To run the tests it needs [solc](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html) installed.
